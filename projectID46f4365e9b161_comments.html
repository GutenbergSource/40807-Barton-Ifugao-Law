<HTML><BODY>This interesting study concentrates on the customary laws of the Ifugao, a Philippine people living in the high-lands of Northern Luzon, refuting the idea (common in 1919) that 'tribal' people are wild and law-less.

<p>The copy of this book (actually an off-print from a magazine article) has some heavy underlining, which should be ignored, but sometimes hurts the OCR. The plates at the end of the work look ugly, but please transcribe the legend if possible. If not, please don't mark them bad (this instruction is only valid for the plates), as I also have the high quality scans, from which I can restore the text during PP.</BODY></HTML>
